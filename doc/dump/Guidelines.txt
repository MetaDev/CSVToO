In SalesForce
Export a rapport with the same fields as Harald Rapport, with the option to export as .csv with comma's (non regional)
field order (mandatory): bookingID, clientID (auto increment, integer only, id), clientName, cleintStreet, clientCountry, clientPostalcode,
clientCity, BTWNumber (tax number), telephoneNumber, faxNumber, Quarter, bookingDate, expiration date, comment, reference (?), bookingAmount, moneyCode

Ik kan u ook nog aanraden om een apart dagboek te gebruiken; zodat dit niet/of toch weinig wordt geopend door de andere gebruikers via de applicatie.

Er kan namelijk slechts één gebruiker per keer in het dagboek werken.

 


In SFToOct
-All csv files need to be in UTF-8 without BOM, java doesn't like BOM, encoding


Client id should be an Integer unique and start from 1

all info used to create bookings from import to Octopus comes from the import csv
no data except constants are used from Octopus.
Meaning, if for example a client has a certain name from the import different from the corresponding name in Octopus then it's the import name that will be used
this for the reason that some clients from the import are mapped to a single client in Octopus

note all format rules that apply on field: dates, doubles,... also in app

a cell has a yellow font if it contains data that's not conform with import or suggestions (either changed by user or, the suggestion failed)

all change to clients and new clients is not permanent until the end button is pressed
