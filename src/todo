check mapping of client (details both side)
first print client info from both sides
than check the mapping data structure 
than remove the client mapping and try to add correct
recheck

mapping between clients should be done by ints not strings

1157 -> 72 (is correctcly mapped but wrong client added, check vat and name of client on both side
0591 -> 285 (should be 181)
1787 
1047
2174 -> 330 (should be 33)

further investigate non matching vat number clients

find DEBUG in code

clients which have a vat error mapping cannot be found through getClientByVATNr
this means that the VAT in the booking is not yet as client in the database

bug is possibly in the code for client ext id generation: 
an existing client which has no ext id is not given one immediately-> do this
client id mappings mixes int and string, only int for uniqueness

an additional fix is to check whether clients which have an octopus relation object
but the mapped client does not have the same id, point to these
e.g. 
factuur nr: 172165booking nr: 2717
Error VAT does not match
factuur VAT nr: BE0808565868 oct booking VAT nr: FR61507835627
SF ID: 0557SF mapped Oct ext ID: 33 SF mapped Oct internal ID: 330 
VAT mapped ext Oct ID: 481 VAT mapped int Oct ID: 308
ignore the VAT particulier
this is not always a real error, sometimes btw is simply different but the clients seems
to be a correct, this could be a typing error which has to be corrected annyway
, thus the user should be able to set a flag once
to agree with mismatching vat on a mapping


in endbutton add the checkbooking text

change import format of files STOAField, now there is one line for each vat taxation

every booking has a single line-> this needs to be translated in 1 or 2 lines of in octopus
2 lines is only required if the bookings mixes amounts of both 21 and 6 VAT these need to be seperated
TODO issue with import of csv non matching length of fields.
